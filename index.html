    Welcome to Riders of the Wasteland 80s-retro mini-game!<br><br><br>
    <img src="src/img/autoduel.png" width="106" height="155"><br>
    In an an effort to give my tribute to the classic game, Autoduel from the mid-80s, I've written a javascript game heavily
    based on the original game published by Origin Systems, Inc. designed by Chuck Bueche (Chuckles) and
    Richard Garriott (Lord British). Who also wrote my all-time favorite games series, Ultima and Ultima Online.<br><br>
    <img src="src/img/autoduel-components.jpg" width="162" height="200"><br>
    Additionally, Autoduel was based on the incredible table top RPG by Steve Jackson, Car Wars. Please go check that
    game out if you've never heard of it, or revisit again if its been years since you played!<br><br><br>
